# EECS106B Robotic Manipulation and Interaction - Spring 2018 - UC Berkeley
## Labs and Project Code 

We build a robotic ball-catching system from Rethink Robotics Baxter Robot arm. The project is decomposed as follows:
​
1. Design a stereo vision system to track the ball and predict the balls trajectory. 
2. Determine the point, time and orientation that the robot should intercept the ball on its trajectory. 
3. Compute the robot conﬁguration to reach the catch point is and generate a path, which brings the robot from its start conﬁguration to the desired catch conﬁguration.
​4. Write a fast controller to move the robot.​
